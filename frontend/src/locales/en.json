    "descriptionText": "Hello ! I'm Artem as you just saw on the left.. I'm a third-year Computer Science student passionate about cybersecurity. My military service as an Infanteer in the Canadian Army shaped my discipline, teamwork, and adaptability, helping me tackle challenges with confidence. I thrive in fast-paced environments, solving problems logically and efficiently while always looking for smarter solutions. Fluent in English, French, Ukrainian, and Russian, I communicate clearly and collaborate easily across teams. Whether leading a project, troubleshooting code, or optimizing workflows, I enjoy working with others to achieve results. Beyond tech, my work as a freelance sports and automotive photographer sharpened my attention to detail and project management skills under tight deadlines. Iâ€™m always learning, adapting, and growing whether in cybersecurity, software development, or leadership with a focus on precision, teamwork, and results.",
