          With a love for problem-solving, I have worked as an infanteer in the Canadian Army,
          honing my skills in punctuality, teamwork, and charisma to engage with others and achieve
          results. Using a logical and straightforward approach, I tackle any problem Iâ€™m faced
          with, combining curiosity and military-level discipline to find effective and efficient
          solutions. Attention to detail and clear communication are critical in overcoming
          challenges, and I consistently support my team while continuously improving my skills and
          effectiveness.
